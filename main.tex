\begin{abstract}
    Berkeley Sockets (a.k.a, BSD, POSIX sockets) are ubiquitously used for network communication. \sockets have been the \emph{de-facto} standard API for network I/O since they were introduced almost four decades ago. 
    
    With the advent of high-speed Ethernet, the performance overhead of \sockets became evident. Attempts to avoid these overheads have spurred a trend kernel bypass techniques, e.g., DPDK, AF\_XDP, Netmap. By bypassing the kernel, these methods attempt to avoid the performance penalties associated with \sockets, i.e., memory copy, system calls, and a slow network stack. However, with great performance comes the great responsibility of re-creating the same network infrastructure that already exists inside the kernel. Kernel developers attempt to close the performance gap by adding new capabilities, most notably XDP, MSG\_ZEROCOPY, and tcp\_mmap, but none of the proposed solutions is a panacea.
    
    In this work, we propose a new paradigm for userspace networking, aiming to shrink the performance gap between \sockets and kernel bypass techniques, allowing application developers to keep the standard \sockets API, network stack (e.g., TCP) and network tools without compromising on performance. We introduce \oursys, a dedicated memory allocator for networking that inherently facilitates zero-copy I/O operations. We modify the kernel memory management system to implement dynamic memory segregation, introducing \textit{I/O only pages} that are shared between the user, the kernel, and the device. These I/O pages are used only for I/O and can never be used by the kernel for any other purposes. This scheme facilitates zero-copy I/O while isolating kernel memory from the user. Additionally, we leverage existing HW capabilities~(e.g., NVIDIA QPs, Intel ADQ) to facilitate isolation between processes.


    \oursys is the first design to provide zero-copy networking while still taking advantage of the robust kernel network stack without compromising the system's security. It is currently used to facilitate efficient networking for our companies next-generation SD-WAN gateways.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have presented \oursys, a novel paradigm for user-space networking. \oursys facilitates zero-overhead network I/O, i.e., zero-copy and exception-less system calls. Unlike previous solutions, \oursys preservers the ubiquitous \sockets API without sacrificing the system's performance or safety.
%There is a rich literature base spanning 50 years on zero-copy techniques, non provide a full solution\cite{song2012performance}. 
\oursys is a much-needed step forward towards a performant and generic zero-copy technique. %A solution that we presume can be applied both to virtual and physical environments.
%We Rule.
