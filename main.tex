\begin{abstract}
    Berkeley Sockets (a.k.a, BSD, POSIX sockets) are ubiquitously used for network communication. \sockets have been the \emph{de-facto} standard API for network I/O since they were introduced almost four decades ago. 
    
    With the advent of high-speed Ethernet, the performance overhead of \sockets became evident. These overheads are particularly burdensome on HTTP proxies and load balancers; their primary operation is to splice TCP sockets, carrying out two operations per network buffer, namely a read and a write. The performance costs of sockets has launched a trend of kernel bypass technologies (e.g., DPDK, Netmap). By bypassing the kernel, these methods attempt to avoid the performance penalties associated with \sockets, i.e., memory copy, system calls, and a slow network stack. However, with great performance comes the great responsibility of re-creating the same network infrastructure that already exists inside the kernel. Kernel developers attempt to close the performance gap by adding new capabilities, most notably XDP, MSG\_ZEROCOPY, and tcp\_mmap, but none of the proposed solutions is a panacea.
    
    In this work, we propose a new paradigm for userspace networking, aiming to shrink the performance gap between \sockets and kernel bypass techniques, allowing application developers to keep the standard \sockets API and network tools without compromising on performance. We introduce a \oursys, a dedicated memory allocator for networking which inherently facilitates zero-copy I/O operations and exception-less system calls. We evaluate a prototype of \oursys, for the use case of TCP socket splicing and compare the performance of \oursys to the state of the art methods. We find that \oursys vastly outperforms standard copying mechanisms like KTCP, \sockets, and io\_submit and performs on par or better than existing zero-copy techniques while preserving the familiar \sockets API.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work we have presented \oursys, a novel paradigm for user space networking. \oursys facilitates zero-overhead network I/O i.e., zero-copy and exception-less system calls. Unlike previous solutions, \oursys preservers the ubiquitous \sockets API without sacrificing performance or safety of the system.


There is a rich literature base spanning 50 years on zero-copy techniques, non provide a full solution\cite{song2012performance}. \oursys is a much needed step forward, towards a performant and generic zero copy technique. A solution that we presume, can be applicable both to virtual and physical environments.
