\section{Introduction}
\sockets provide a convenient API for user-space I/O, but since their inception network speeds have outstripped those of the CPU. Furthermore, while CPU and memory clock speeds have stagnated in the past decade, Ethernet speeds are growing steadily ~\cite{roadmap}. The greatest performance penalty is due to memory copying, which can take a big part of the CPU cycles ~\cite{desendmsg} and hurt other processes by "polluting" the shared L3 cache and putting additional pressure on the memory channels \cite{markuze2016true}. 

The performance hit due to memory copying is well known. Attempts to ameliorate the costs of moving data have spawn numerous partial optimizations in the kernel (e.g., splice, sednfile, MSG\_ZEROCOPY, tcp\_mmap). A comprehensive solution is missing resulting in the adoption of kernel bypass technologies (e.g., KTCP, Netmap, XDP). Kernel bypass solutions eschew the rich networking infrastructure, developed and perfected in the kernel, leaving the developers with the need to re-develop existing infrastructure (e.g., IP,TCP,ICMP,).

There is a rich literature base spanning 50 years on zero-copy techniques, non provide a full solution (see Related Work). \oursys is an additional step forward towards a usable zero copy technique, that can be applicable both to virtual and physical environments.
